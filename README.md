My name is Brave Normakoh, a mechanical engineer by profession with deep love and passion for tech-related career. So I coined my passion into soft tech skills to better my profession, with the dream of making machines seamlessly reliable, intelligent and robust with the power of machine learning. I also build good-looking full stack websites using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS.
